# RORC
Recuperative Organic Rankine Cycle. The model is able to calculate the power cycle First and Sencond Laws of thermodynamics efficiencies for a "dry" fluid. The heat source is set as satured steam and the heat sink is cooling water. For all 3 heat exchangers, the minimum temperature approach is fixed at 10 K. The heat exchanger pinch is found with the aid of the Scipy.optimize.fsolve function by deviding its heat duty into 100 small values and calculating the the resulting cold and hot streams intermidiate tempeartures. After executing the script inside the 'main.py' file, the user shall obtain 4 plots: The power cycle T x S diagram, and the boiler, recuperator and condenser composite curves. In addition, 2 ".txt" files are generated: 'CyclePerformance.txt', containg important information about the power cycle and equimpment, and 'StreamData.txt', containing information about streams. The required packages can be found in "requirements.txt" and the power cycle process flow diagram is depicted in 'ORC.png' file.
